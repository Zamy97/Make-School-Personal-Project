# My App Name

Have not decided my app name yet!
​
## Audience
[Who cares/uses it? why?]

People who travels sometimes but have hard time trying to figure out what they need to pack for their trip. Like me who doesn't have any idea of what to pack when I fly to NY! I often take too much or too little and I want to solve that problem. 
​
## Experience
A user opens the app... and given an option to add trips on the first page with a button that they could click on it'll take them to choose their destination and dates and next page will ask them where they will be staying during their trip and there will be a create my trip button which will pull all these info together and suggest them few things that they might consider bringing with them with check and cross option!
